# DOLLY CLOCK :hourglass_flowing_sand: :dolls:

![GitHub CI](https://github.com/angeldollface/dolly-clock/actions/workflows/react.yml/badge.svg)

***A clock for your browser home page. :hourglass_flowing_sand: :dolls:***

## ABOUT :books:

I was recently watching some tutorials and stumbled across someone who had a clock on their browser start page. I thought this to be quite a good idea and decided to write my own clock widget using React. This repository contains the source code for this clock widget.

## USAGE :hammer:

To use this clock widget (Website, actually!), simply set the URL [`https://angeldollface.art/dolly-clock/`](https://angeldollface.art/dolly-clock/) as your browser's start page and restart your browser. To search for things on Google type your query into the input field and press the `SEARCH` button.
